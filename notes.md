# we have to create a pop up on see project link which shows project details.

# solution

# add unique id to every project in html
# add key id and its corresponding value same as in nhtml to every project object.
# add event listner to all the buttons
# select id of every project
# define a new function called popUp and call it and pass it projeect-id
# check for each project object that if project.id === project_id, create an element dynamically.
# add html and css to it and push it to body. this is your popup
